Here's some bash scripts to simulate the wonders of a macro!

## Install instructions

1. Create the needed path! `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/sleephunter`
2. Move scripts to the created folder... `unzip jewhn-master.zip` and `mv jewhn-master/* ~/.local/share/sleephunter/` :)
3. Remove the non-script files (readme and oh_shit_key.txt) `rm ~/.local/share/sleephunter/*{.md,.txt,.png}`
3. If the scripts aren't already executable, make them so `chmod +x ~/.local/share/sleephunter/*`
4. Create the shortcuts through your "Shortcuts" menu, including the "oh shit key" (make sure to use the full path as the command aka. `bash -c "/home/jewhn/.local/share/sleephunter/arena_combo"`)
  - Open the "Keyboard" settings
  - Add your HOTKEY (matching your script HOTKEY), and the above bash command pointing to the script

frost_arrow and d2 are toggles :)
