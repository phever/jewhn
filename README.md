Here's some bash scripts to simulate the wonders of a macro!

## Install instructions

1. Create the needed path! `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/sleephunter`
2. Move scripts to the created folder :)
3. If the scripts aren't already executable, make them so `chmod +x`
4. Create the shortcuts through your "Shortcuts" menu, including the "oh shit key" (make sure to use the full path as the command aka. `/home/jewhn/.local/share/sleephunter/arena_combo`)

frost_arrow and d2 are toggles :)
